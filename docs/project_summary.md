# Paperboy Project Summary

## Overview

Paperboy is a comprehensive news collection and processing system designed to gather, translate, and analyze news articles from a variety of sources, with a focus on Taiwan, China, and international relations in the Asia-Pacific region.

## Core Components

1. **Dynamic Scraper Pipeline**
   - Modular architecture for easy addition of new sources
   - Configuration-driven source management
   - Deduplication system to avoid duplicates
   - Error handling and anti-blocking measures

2. **Translation Pipeline**
   - Automatic language detection
   - Machine translation using NLLB model
   - Support for multiple languages
   - Preservation of original metadata

3. **Utility Modules**
   - Article caching system
   - File management utilities
   - Logging infrastructure

## Implemented Features

- [x] Dynamic loading of scraper modules
- [x] Robust error handling and retries
- [x] Article deduplication
- [x] Configuration-based setup
- [x] Language detection
- [x] Non-English article translation
- [x] Command-line interfaces for both pipelines
- [x] Combined scraping and translation workflow

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.6+
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, Requests
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLLB-200 Translation Model, Langdetect
- **Data Handling**: JSON for storage

## Current Coverage

The system currently has scrapers implemented for:
- Taipei Times (English)
- Xinhua (English)
- China Daily (English)

And can translate from multiple languages including:
- Chinese (Simplified and Traditional)
- Japanese
- Korean
- Russian
- And many more

## Usage Workflows

1. **Scraping Only**:
   ```
   python run_scraper.py
   ```

2. **Translation Only**:
   ```
   python -m pipelines.translation_pipeline --input data/articles.json
   ```

3. **Combined Workflow**:
   ```
   python scrape_and_translate.py
   ```

## Future Development

- [ ] Implementation of additional scraper modules
- [ ] Full-text article extraction
- [ ] Topic classification and tagging
- [ ] Sentiment analysis
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Web API for accessing the data
- [ ] User interface for exploring articles
