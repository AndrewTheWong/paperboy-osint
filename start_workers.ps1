.DESCRIPTION
    This script starts dedicated Celery workers for each pipeline step:
    - Scraper worker
    - Translation worker  
    - Tagging worker
    - Embedding worker
    - Clustering worker
    - Orchestrator worker

.PARAMETER Workers
    Specific workers to start (default: all)
    Options: scraper, translator, tagger, embedder, cluster, orchestrator, all

.PARAMETER Concurrency
    Number of worker processes per worker type (default: 1)

.EXAMPLE
    .\start_workers.ps1
    Start all workers with default settings

.EXAMPLE
    .\start_workers.ps1 -Workers "scraper,translator" -Concurrency 2
    Start only scraper and translator workers with 2 processes each
