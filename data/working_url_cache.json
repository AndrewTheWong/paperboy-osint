Trump\u2019s Libya plan would too,\u201d May 19). Yes, we have to be reminded that what President Trump is planning is a repeat of the horrors of the Nazi era and that there are legal procedures today to prevent this.My late husband was on the St. Louis at the age of 7 with his 3-year-old brother, grandmother, mother and father. They were Jewish refugees from Berlin. The father's store burned down during Kristallnacht. My mother-in-law, through friends, found out about getting into Cuba via this voyage when they were refused entrance into the U.S. at that time. Germany convinced Cuba to reject them, after which the ship turned back toward Europe and its concentration camps.Fortunately, there were interventions plotted by the captain, the Jewish Refugee Organization and passengers on the trip to avoid going back. The Vendig family ended up in Belgium, then Vichy France and were finally rescued with help from Switzerland. The family finally got to the U.S. in 1946.

To illustrate his point, he referenced the Great Northern War between Russia and Sweden, which lasted 21 years. One of its most famous episodes was Peter the Great's order to dismantle church bells and melt them down for artillery, which was in short supply.Today, artillery is again in short supply, but since the Great Northern War, the technology for producing artillery barrels has, to put it mildly, changed a tad. Therefore, the Russians must now supply it to the front, not through Peter the Great's methods but by tapping into their Cold War stockpiles.As with tanks, these stockpiles are not endless. Meanwhile, Russia's production of new artillery and barrels appears unable to keep up with the demands of the front and the rate of losses.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMoscow's difficulties in bringing new artillery systems into service do not mean that Russian forces will stop firing any time soon or that Ukraine is on the verge of victory.However, artillery is a cornerstone of Russian offensive tactics.

The turnout was remarkable, the largest since the end of the armed conflict, and a powerful testament to the strength and resilience of the Tamil nation. The commemoration was just one of a series of events that took place across the North-East this month. Each and every one, alongside the numerous gatherings that took place in cities around the world, from London to Sydney, affirmed what Tamils have asserted for decades: that the massacres which left as many as 167,769 unaccounted constitute a genocide. This recognition is becoming a growing global reality. Heads of states are now routinely releasing messages to mark to occasion, with senior political figures and institutions increasingly acknowledging the scale and nature of the atrocities.
