As Canada endures another heavy wildfire season, a group of resourceful farmers in British Columbia became an ad hoc fire brigade to help a neighbor. ByNasuna Stuart-UlinandVjosa Isai Visuals byNasuna Stuart-Ulin Nasuna Stuart-Ulin reported from Goodlow, British Columbia, and Vjosa Isai reported from Toronto. Smoke was darkening the skies, and flames from an out-of-control wildfire ripping through this remote stretch of western Canada were creeping ominously close to the farm that has been in Jake van Angeren\u2019s family for 70 years. Official evacuation alerts had sounded in Goodlow, an agricultural community near Alberta in northeastern British Columbia, setting off a chain reaction among families who had packed their bags ready to be ordered to leave as wildfires this month swallowed up swaths of land. But not Mr. van Angeren. Instead, he and his neighbors filled up water tanks, unraveled hoses, cleared strips of land of combustible plants to create a firebreak and then stepped toward the flames. They saved the van Angeren farm. Canada\u2019s wildfire season, which generally stretches from April to October, is in full swing in the western part of the country, consuming nearly nine million acres so far across four provinces and forcing thousands of people to make difficult choices, sometimes at a moment\u2019s notice when flames approach.

The Israeli military, in an initial analysis, believes the heavily fortified nuclear site at Fordo has sustained serious damage from the American strike on Sunday, but has not been completely destroyed, according to two Israeli officials with knowledge of the matter. The officials also said it appeared Iran had moved equipment, including uranium, from the site. A senior U.S. official similarly acknowledged that the American strike on the Fordo site did not destroy the heavily fortified facility but said the strike had severely damaged it, taking it \u201coff the table.\u201d The person noted that even 12 bunker-busting bombs could not destroy the site. The damage assessments by Israel and the United States are ongoing, and they have not made any final conclusions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. In its overnight strikes, the United States took aim at three nuclear sites, including dropping 30,000 pound, bunker-busting bombs on Fordo, Iran\u2019s most critical site. In a briefing Sunday morning, top Pentagon officials echoed President Trump\u2019s claims of success, while also saying the final assessment would take time. Gen. Dan Caine, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the initial assessment indicated that all three sites sustained \u201csevere damage and destruction,\u201d but added that it was too soon to say whether Iran retained some nuclear capability.
